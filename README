Simple analytics tool for a low-traffic website. 

Usage: 
1. Copy <?php include('track.php'); ?> to the website source. Visitor's data are stored in ip.txt, each line being:
[ip] [timestamp]

2. For the analysis, call: python track-visits.py

A freely available hostip database is queried via API. Unfortunately, it's somewhat incomplete.
